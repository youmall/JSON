Hello, I’m Youri Malleck-Ahmed.
I have been working as an Integration Architect for well over 10 years.
I have honed my skills to master the full integration landscape in an enterprise, covering:
- Designing RESTful Client APIs and Integration APIs, with security factored in from the start.
- Generation and Publishing of events to scale out and move to a Near Real-Time Enterprise
- Designed a generic Event data model used across the enterprise to support Near Real-Time processing requirements
- Event Handlers to synchronize/ingest data in subscriber systems, taking care to design for re-starts of crashed activities.
- Concurrent processing of Event Handlers, with throttling to scale out dynamically as per configuration
- Designing processes so that unknowns on timeouts/crashes are sorted out in an automated way.
- Payments (E.g. SWIFT, IPS, eCommerce, Request To Pay, Bill Payment, Integration will Biller Aggregator)
- Designed Tables to support Payment Channel Operators (like Bill Aggregators, Merchant Aggregators), Payment Channels, Trades, PayPoints, and all the commissions and charges that go with it.
- Designing secure APIs to support UI flows like the ubiquitous capture, submit, confirm, and authorize.
- Designing of re-usable service functions supporting interfaces.
- Documenting and applying patterns that have been proven to work.
- Finding ways to make legacy systems work with newer systems, message formats, and interfaces (like RESTful).
I am open to very short consultancies as my job and the learning that goes with it is very demanding
